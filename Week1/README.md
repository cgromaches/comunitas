# Week 1

## 02/19 - 02/24 Defining Assumptions

- [x] Confirm your team members by completing the Team Form: **DONE**
- [x] Choose which challenge you are going to be working on: **SDG #11 Sustainable Cities and Communities**

 - [x] **Define specific problem you're addressing:**

commūnitās is targeting the lack of individually tackle economic, social and climate change issues. The platform brings the community together in order to reach common goals by creating DAO’s to archive it.  

Though blockchain DAOs, communities could pool for a common interest. Blockchain allows users to register goals, develop their collective policies, contract specifications, pool together -use of compound interest considered- and eventually, reach that goal.  

We want to create a replicable, from global to local DAO framework in order to be able and facilitate the creation of multiple organizations where people come together to sustainability solve and improve situations in a wide range of areas, following the UN SDG: 

* Ex1: MEET AND WELCOME PEOPLE (SDG11). Neighbours invest in purchasing a housing block on space permit. Since neighbours don’t own the property, they just pay for the use of the property during a determined period of time. Eventually, when they leave the property, they get their money back. All the terms & conditions are inside the created DAO.

* Ex2: BUY BETTER STUFF (SDG12). BUY FAIRLY (SDG1). Directly link consumers and producers in a specific place (pool Km0 consumption), creating pick-up nodes in order to reduce the CO2 emissions impact, besides promoting local and seasonal ethical consumption. 

* Ex3: WORK WITH PURPOSE (SDG8). Pooling to stop speculation buying protected or environmental & culturally protected land. 

* Ex4: USE GREEN ENERGY (SDG7).  A neighbouring community decides to invest in solar panels, posts the initiative on the blockchain platform. Neighbours pool together, so could do other users as an altruistic practice or in order to get equity risen by the compound interest.

* Ex5: INVENT SMART SOLUTIONS (SDG9). The platform would facilitate the creation of public transport initiatives raisen by the users in order to improve the public network. Governments, companies and public/private associations could pool. 

* Ex6: JOIN GROUPS AND HAVE FUN (SDG17). LOVE ALL LIFE AND GET OUTDOORS (SDG15). Neighbours could promote a green space -like an orchard or urban vegetable paths in order to boost community, promote self-sufficient consumption and reduce CO2 while improving their leisure time. 

* Ex7: WASTE (SDG2). Work towards completing material cycles by creating recycling areas separated to collectively separate materials, organic waste, etc to use/sell it afterwards.

 - [x] **Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/use_blochain.png" alt="Why Blockchain">
</p>

The simple existence of the DAO* (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) in our project made Blockchain essencial as, by definition, DAO's are built on Blockchain. But we need Blochain for this other reasons too:

	* We need a shared write access database
	* Everybody could participate (untrusted writers)
	* No trusted 3rd parties

We have a really good Blockchain use case!

DAOs are the most cost-effective and fair business model ever conceived. They shore up the weaknesses of traditional centralized businesses but also of blockchain projects, with the former subject to central points of weakness, middlemen, and unaligned stakeholder interests. A true DAO has only a single interest to protect: that of the business itself. It requires no employees or executive managers, thereby providing a service without consideration of salaries, intermediaries, or even profits. Businesses can survive on the most razor-thin margins imaginable, and only need to cover the cost of existing—nothing more.

 - [x] **What demographics do you serve? What is the size of the market?**

This technology could be addressed to anyone with Internet connection access. Since it could benefit all types of communities and societies, the target market is worldwide. 
On July 2019 this data corresponded to 4.500.000 M people, that represents 59% of the world population (data reference: https://marketing4ecommerce.net/usuarios-internet-mundo/)

 - [x] **What other solutions are currently being used to address this problem? (other companies, workarounds, 
systems or processes that can compete with or substitute your product)**

Considering that nowadays this kind of platform doesn’t exist, probably the closest idea could be the crowdfunding business model mingled with the cooperative system. 
A user posts an initiative on the platform, the initiative gets approved, crowd funds the initiative and finally, crowd has equity in the initiative. This responds as an equity model, close to the concept of cooperatives, without necessarily registering the initiatives as cooperative business.  

This concept lacks `continuity` as well as the decentralization of the project's authorship. Crowdfundings ends when the project begins and are owned by a person or team.

With our solution, the DAO in charge of managing the project remains permanently active and anyone can enter/exit the project (defined in the DAO itself). Thus, projects of much longer duration and owned by the community can be supplied, such as the creation of self-managed homes for the elderly or other projects that currently can only be carried out by a public administration (slow process and bureaucratic obstacles).

 - [x] **What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?**

Regarding the geopolitical, cultura-social-economic factors, it would depend strictly on the law of each country. Blockchain early-adopters state legislators could take advantage of this sustainable-economical-social business model creator to allow communities to work for a common goal within their country. 

Nonetheless, an investment to raise awareness on the advantages of Blockchain technology would be needed in order to grow the platform and reach the maximum number of users as possible.
