## Comunitas 

commūnitās is targeting the lack of individually tackle economic, social and climate change issues. The platform brings the community together in order to reach common goals by creating DAO’s to archive it.  

Though blockchain DAOs, communities could pool for a common interest. Blockchain allows users to register goals, develop their collective policies, contract specifications, pool together -use of compound interest considered- and eventually, reach that goal.  

We want to create a replicable, from global to local DAO framework in order to be able and facilitate the creation of multiple organizations where people come together to sustainability solve and improve situations in a wide range of areas.
